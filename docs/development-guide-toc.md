# Primer App development guide table of contents

## A note about the scope of this guide

The primary audience for this guide is anyone who'd like to build the
project for the purposes of testing it locally, making a code
contribution to the project, or generally just satisfying their
curiosity about how our implementation works.

Please note that this development guide does not cover the syntax,
semantics, or design of the Primer programming language; nor does it
describe the details of the Primer language server API. The former
will eventually be published to a separate website, and the latter
will be available from this project's companion project,
[`primer`](https://github.com/hackworthltd/primer).
